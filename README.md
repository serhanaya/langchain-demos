# llm-local-demos
This repository contains a collection of demonstrations and projects focused on working with local Language Models (LLMs) using tools like Langchain. The goal of this repository is to explore the capabilities and applications of local LLMs, which can be deployed and used on-premise, without relying on cloud-based services.
